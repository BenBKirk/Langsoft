<h1>How to Use this Program</h1>
<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
<p class="normal">
    <b>1.</b> Simply click on a word to look it up in the online dictionaries. <br>
    <b>2.</b> If you would like to look up a phrase, simply click and drag to select the phrase you would like to look up.<br>
    <b>3.</b> The dictionaries/websites can be customised other the settings page.<br>
    <b>4.</b> The words/phrases you look up can be saved as Anki flashcards by using the flashcard generator in the top right.<br>
    <b>5.</b> There also is a build-in discourse highlighter that can be used to highlight discourse features. This can also be customised under the settings page. Apart from this highlighting is possible by right clicking on selected text and choosing a colour.
</p>

<h2>Supported Document Formats</h2>
<p class="normal">
    <b>1.</b> HTML is the recommended format to save and load your files in, as it will display well and will keep highlighting etc. HTML files can also be edited in Microsoft Word. So, if there is some formatting that you would like to do but it isn’t possible within this program, for example changing the line spacing, simply save it as HTML and open it in Word. After you have finished, save it again as a HTML file. Note that, if you have added pictures, they will be sometimes be saved in a separate folder, just leave that folder so as not to remove the pictures.<br>
    <b>2.</b> support for DOCX and TXT has been added but it would be better to only use this to import basic text, but try to save as HTML after importing.<br>
    <b>3.</b> Reading PDFs is also supported but the formatting can be a bit interesting sometimes.<br>
    <b>4.</b> Pro tip: if you right click on most websites in your browser to should be able to download the whole web page as HTML and then open it just like any other text you are studying.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Importing Audio</h2>
<p class="normal">
    <b>1.</b> As of now, audio is automatically imported if the program finds a file with the same name in the same folder. <br>
    <b>2.</b> For example, if you have sesi.HTML and sesi.MP3 in the same folder, the program should automatically import it sesi.MP3.<br> 
    <b>3.</b> Note: Be sure to select the HTML/TXT/DOCX file and not the audio. In the future, I will make it so that it does not matter which one you select.<br>
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Anki Flashcards</h2>
<p class="normal">
    <b>1.</b> There is a flashcard generator in the top righthand corner.<br>
    <b>2.</b> The front of the flashcard will be automatically filled with word that was clicked in bold and the context around it too.<br>
    <b>3.</b> If you have it enabled in the settings, the back of the flashcard can be auto filled too, but this could stop working at anytime as it is a free google translate API and not the official one (otherwise it wouldn’t be free to use).<br>
    <b>4.</b> Pictures are supported if they are dragged in from google images like this:<br>
    <img src="src/img/help.jpg" >
    <br>
    <b>Note:</b> Up to this point only one picture can be added to a single flashcard.<br>
</p>

<h2>Discourse Highlighter</h2>
<p class="normal">
    <b>1.</b> If there is a large file, it may look as though it has frozen (I will make a loading bar in the future) but it most likely hasn’t, so just wait until its finished.<br>
    <b>2.</b> In the settings you can either enter a list of words separed by a commas, or Regex for more advanced selection.<br>
    <b>Note:</b> There is no way to toggle settings on and off, so if you don’t want to see the highlighting you can either set the colour to white/back (same as the background) or select and remove formatting by either right clicking or using the T symbol on the main toolbar.<br>

<h2>Keyboard shortcuts</h2>
<pre>
    Ctrl + Right/Left Arrow keys    ->  Move to next/previous word
    Ctrl + Up Arrow Key             ->  Look up word under cursor
    Ctrl + Down Arrow Key           ->  Save Flashcard

    Alt + Right/Left Arrow Key      ->  Skip audio forward/backward
    Alt + Up Arrow Key              ->  Pause/Play Audio

    Tip: To select more than one word while jumping (using ctrl + arrow key) 
         hold the shift key down at the same time.

    This is still a very early version and so I expect there to still be some issues/bugs but would appreciate if you let me know (benjaminbarriekirk@gmail.com)
